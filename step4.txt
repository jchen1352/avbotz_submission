A. The sound is to the top left.
B. The sound hits C first, so the sound is above it. The sound then hits B, so the sound is to the left.
C. A hyperbola!
D. (-3.5, 4)
E. Given three time values is pretty trivial because then you know the distance from the sound to the first hydrophone. In reality, we're only given two time differences, which is a lot harder, and I could not figure out how to find the intersection of two general hyperbolas.
