B. The sound hits C first, so the sound is above it. The sound then hits B, so the sound is to the left.
C. A hyperbola!
D. (-3.5, 4)
E. Given two time differences, we have two hyperbolas. To find where they intersect, use Newton's method. First find an estimate using the asymptotes, then improve the estimate.
